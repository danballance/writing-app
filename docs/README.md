# ScribeAI developer documentation

This directory describes the application as it works now. It is intended to get a developer from a fresh checkout to making safe changes without first reverse-engineering the UI, editor, and suggestion state machine.

## What this application is

ScribeAI is an Electron writing workspace with a React renderer. The current implementation combines:

- a BlockNote rich-text editor;
- persistent live and development-injected writing-partner feeds;
- an inbox for reading, dismissing, pinning, and previewing suggestions;
- desktop workspace cards for keeping references over the editor;
- responsive navigation and writing-partner panels;
- SQLite document, source, suggestion, transcript, and agent-memory persistence;
- a background Pi agent with user-configured inference providers.

Electron owns SQLite and Pi in utility processes, imports text, Markdown, JSON, PDF, and DOCX sources, and restores the workspace after restart. Development uses the same runtime with Vite renderer HMR and a dedicated mock-suggestion window. Routing and most document-management controls remain presentation-only.

## Fastest route into the codebase

1. Follow [Getting started](getting-started.md) and run the app and checks.
2. Read [Architecture](architecture.md) for state ownership and module boundaries.
3. Read [Editor and suggestion system](editor-and-suggestions.md) before changing feed, preview, pin, or inbox behavior.
4. Use [UI and accessibility](ui-and-accessibility.md) for responsive layout, resizing, styling, and keyboard behavior.
5. Use [Testing and quality](testing-and-quality.md) before submitting a change.
6. Read [Desktop runtime](desktop-runtime.md) before changing persistence, IPC, source import, or Pi behaviour.
7. Use [Extension guide](extension-guide.md) when extending those boundaries or adding a new suggestion kind.

## Current user-visible behavior

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Editor | Electron hydrates and autosaves the current BlockNote document. |
| Writing partner | Electron receives committed suggestions from the Pi agent or its development-only mock controller. |
| Text suggestions | Snippets, facts, and terms can become an editable document preview, then be accepted or cancelled. |
| Structural suggestions | Outlines and layouts render nested cards; mind maps render through Mermaid. They are references, not insertable previews. |
| Pins | A suggestion can be frozen into the Pins section. On desktop it can then be placed, moved, resized, stacked, and returned. |
| Responsive layout | Below `80rem`, navigation and writing partner use modal drawers. At `80rem` and above they become independently collapsible, resizable columns. |
| Persistence | Electron restores the current document, sources, suggestion inbox, pins, workspace cards, transcripts, and agent memory. |
| Sources | Electron imports text, Markdown, JSON, PDF, and DOCX files into the active project. |
| Static controls | Navigation destinations, document tabs, New Document, history, export, share, and overflow actions have no application behavior yet. |

## Terms used in the code

- **Suggestion feed**: the subscription interface that emits suggestion and agent-status events.
- **Inbox entry**: a live suggestion tracked by the reducer, including viewed, stale, and withdrawn flags.
- **Pinned entry**: a deep-copied, stable suggestion snapshot removed from the live inbox queue.
- **Workspace pin**: a pinned suggestion moved onto the desktop editor canvas with geometry and stacking state.
- **Preview**: a temporary, editable custom BlockNote block created from a text suggestion. Only one preview may be active.

## Important implementation constraints

- [`App.tsx`](../src/App.tsx) is the renderer composition root. It connects the required Electron bridge, hydration, autosave, feed, previews, panel state, and workspace pins.
- [`inboxReducer`](../src/suggestions/inbox.ts) is the source of truth for suggestion lifecycle rules. UI components dispatch intent; they should not recreate those rules locally.
- [`SuggestionFeed`](../src/suggestions/types.ts) is the event-stream boundary. The Electron adapter maps committed desktop events into renderer events.
- The app assumes a browser DOM. `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, media queries, `ResizeObserver`, and pointer capture are used directly.
